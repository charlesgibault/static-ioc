  <comment>The goal of this project is to allow the use of the
  Inversion of Control pattern at compile time so it can be applied
  in any context, and for virtually any langage: IoC configuration
  files are resolved at compile time and converted into the
  appropriate piece of code. IoC configuration file uses the
  very-wide spread Spring framework XML format. Generated code
  won&apos;t depend on any framework, making it easy to integrate it
  into any kind of application. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
